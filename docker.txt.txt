3 paste this in Dockerfile :

FROM openjdk:8-jre-alpine
COPY target/docker-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar /usr/share
WORKDIR /usr/share
ENTRYPOINT ["java","-cp", "docker-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar", "comm.myCompany.docker.App"]

4 In above docker-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar is name of jar created, we have to give this name only.
5 In above comm.mycompany.docker is package name and App is class name
